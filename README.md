​
​
## Description
​
Katalog is for the everyday artist that wants to organize their inspirations, whether this is a photo, a quote, or a link to another website. Each inspiration will be a post and the user can create, update, or delete a post. In a sense, the application is a content management system for the everyday kind of artist.
​
## USER STORIES (MVP)

​
**Landing page** - As a user, without session, I would like to see a public landing page with a carousel of generic "posts" created by other users to encourage them to sign up. The sign up and login will be available on this page as well. 
​
**Sign up** - As a user I can create an account with authentication included to help me create a strong password. 
​
**Login** - As a user I can log in from any landing page. 
​
**Logout** - As a user that is logged in, I can log out from any page I am on. 
​
