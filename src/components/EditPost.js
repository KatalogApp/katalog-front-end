// componentDidMount fetches the data from the postClient (the id is in the params)
// and puts the existing data in the state (like the single post so far)
// we render the data of the state

// handleChange changes the data of the state

// handlesubmit sends changes to the backend through the postClient
// and redirects to whichever view you want to send the user

// you have all of these things in other components, you have to mix them

// make sure you add the route to this component in App.js

// CLUE: the link to this component doesn't go in the navbar, it goes in single component, along the delete button but instead is a <Link>
